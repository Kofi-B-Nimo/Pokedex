# Pokedex
Creating my own small pokedex of a few Pokémon using python!

## Project Overview
This project uses Python to retrieve data on Pokémon from the PokéAPI. Key attributes like name, height, weight, and type are extracted and organized into a Pandas DataFrame for easy analysis and exploration.
