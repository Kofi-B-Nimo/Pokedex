# Pokedex
Creating my own small pokedex of a few Pok√©mon using python!

## Project Overview
This project uses Python to retrieve data on Pok√©mon from the Pok√©API. Key attributes like name, height, weight, and type are extracted and organized into a Pandas DataFrame for easy analysis and exploration.

---

## Step 1
To begin the project, my initial steps involve taking a look at the PokeAPI, and getting insight of how exactly the data's structured in order for me to understand how to go about scraping the website. after checking out the website, I can say the data is formatted using key-value pairs (JSON formatting).

## Step 2
The next step involves using the Requests library in Python to extract the necessary data from the PokeAPI, which includes pokemon number, name, type,height, weight, location, and etc. I should be able to achieve this by creating a for-loop and iterrating through the desired number of pokemon (using each pokemon's ID number) to extract the data I'm looking for. 

so......
I had to slow my role a bit and not try and extract all that data at once. I focused first on just making sure i could extract the names of the pokemon based on their ID numbers.
So step 2 consists of creating a function that would:
- Initiate a for-loop that loops through the pokemon id numbers
- While looping through the pokemon id's, each time the request status is checked
- If the request status is a success; the function returns the name of each pokemon within the range provided 

Here's a screenshot of what that looks like and the output return for step 2

Code:

Output:

## Step 3
this step will consist of retrieving all the info wanted from the API and placing the data into a dictionary.
The dictionary; 'pokemon_dict' was created to, for now, to house all the scraped data and this is a brief outline of the process:
- Create empty lists outside the function and name them corresponding to the requested data within the for-loop
- Take all the the requested data being printed within the for-loop and assign the data to variables
- Then append the data within the for-loop to the lists outside the for-loop (so that everytime an iteration cycle is complete all the requested information for each pokemon is added)
- Once all the necesarry data has been appended to the lists, a variable called pokemon_data was created that contained a zip of all 8 lists (poke_ids, pokemon_names, types, moves1, moves2, moves3, heights, weights)
- In order to create a dictionary a dict comprehension was utilized by assigning `poke_ids` as the key and the remaining 7 lists and the values
- The created dictionary was called `pokemon_dict`

Appending data into lists:

---

## Step 4 
- Created a DataFrame from pokemon_dict using `pd.DataFrame()` and named it `pokedex_df`.
- Upon inspecting the DataFrame, the layout wasn‚Äôt what I expected ‚Äî Pok√©mon IDs became columns instead of rows.
- Used `.transpose()` to flip the DataFrame so that each Pok√©mon became a row and the data types (like name, type, height, etc.) became columns.
- This successfully flipped the table to match the structure I envisioned.
- Next, I created a list called dfcolumn_names to manually assign readable column headers.
- Used `pokedex_table.columns = dfcolumn_names` to rename the columns to match the data under them.
- The result: a well-structured, clean DataFrame with Pok√©mon data organized row by row and labeled clearly.

Dataframe transpose:

##  Step 5

Wanted to tidy up a few final details to make the DataFrame cleaner and easier to understand.

- Height conversion:
  - The API gave height values in decimeters (why? I don‚Äôt know ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è).
  - I looked up the conversion rate ‚Äî multiplying by `10` gave me centimeters.
  - Applied the change directly to the `'height'` column.

- Weight conversion:
  - Weight was recorded in hectograms (again... why? üòÖ).
  - Divided the `'weight'` column by `10` to convert it to kilograms.
  - Worked like magic ‚Äî now it's readable and makes sense.

- Renamed columns:
  - After converting the units, I updated the column names for clarity:
    - `'height'` ‚Üí `'Height (cm)'`
    - `'weight'` ‚Üí `'Weight (kg)'`
   
Unit conversion:

Result after conversion:

- Formatted Pok√©mon names:
  - The API returned all lowercase names.
  - Used `.str.title()` on the `'name'` column to convert them to proper title case (e.g., `bulbasaur` ‚Üí `Bulbasaur`).

Changing pokemon name letter case:

## Conclusion? Final Thoughts

This project was a great way to put everything together ‚Äî from working with APIs and handling real-world JSON data, to cleaning and organizing it with Python and pandas. Along the way, I ran into a few unexpected quirks (like decimeters and hectograms üòÖ), but figuring those things out made the process even more rewarding.

In the end, I was able to build a clean, readable DataFrame with useful Pok√©mon info that could be used for further analysis, filtering, or even visualizations. Definitely learned a lot and had fun doing it ‚Äî and there‚Äôs still more I could add down the line.
