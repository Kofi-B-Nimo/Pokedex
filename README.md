# Pokedex
Creating my own small pokedex of a few Pokémon using python!

## Project Overview
This project uses Python to retrieve data on Pokémon from the PokéAPI. Key attributes like name, height, weight, and type are extracted and organized into a Pandas DataFrame for easy analysis and exploration.

## Step 1
To begin the project, my initial steps involve taking a look at the PokeAPI, and getting insight of how exactly the data's structured in order for me to understand how to go about scraping the website. after checking out the website, I can say the data is formatted using key-value pairs (JSON formatting).
